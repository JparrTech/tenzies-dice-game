# Tenzies React Dice Game
Tenzies Webapp using React is a project who's purpose is to reinforce the React fundamental React skills I have been learning recently.  


## Skills Reinforced:
* Responsive Design: Use of VH and VW units, making displayed content scaled relative to the viewport. 
* Use of NanoId library as a quick way to generate unique keys for components. 
* Knowing useEffect is needed and when it isn't - (it can be easy to overuse it).
* Conditional styling based on state. 
* More use of event listeners, more mapping through arrays of objects, more practice with CSS.
